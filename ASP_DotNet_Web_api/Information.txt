REST
(representation state transfer)

-> Style of Architecture to build Web Services
-> Set of Principles

Rest is Stateless ( The Server should not store any Client State in the Server)

>Net core provides powerfull platform for bulding web services
HTTP verbs ,  Routing ,  Model Binding , COntent negotitation  , Response Type.

http verbs
Get, post, update , Delete ,  Patch , Options.

get -  get all employees
get  -  get all employyees/id
post  -  Create an Employee
put  -  Update an Employee
Delete  -  Delete an Employee

Dependencies nuget
Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer
Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools



DBContext Class

> maintaining connection to DB
> Track Changes
> Perform CRUD Operations
> Bridge Between domain names and DataBase


                CONTROLLER <>  DBCONTEXT <>  DATABASE



DEPENDENCY INJECTION

> Design pattern to increase Maintainibility and Testablility
> Dependency injection  built into  ASP.net  Core
> DI container  is Responsible for Creating and Managing Instances


Migration
Add-Migration "First Migration"(Name of Migration)
Update-Database


NEWID() is used to create guid inside db



DTOs (DATA TRANSFER OBJECTS)
> used  to transfer  data Between  Different layer
> Typically Contain a Subset  of the Properties in the domain Model
> For example  Transferring  data over a  Network


               [ CLIENT ]  -  [DTO (Data Transfer Layer)]   --  [[ A P I ]]  --  [DOMAIN MODEL]  -- [DATABASE]  ->

> we have domain model inside api .it is good practice to add a layer of DTO .
> we never Send domain model directly to client but we send DTO instead.
> Once we get dbcontext class provide us list of domain model then we do mapping  between domain model  and the DTO . So the we send DTO back to the client.
> if info comes from client . we receive DTO then we convert  DTO to domain model then we send  domail model using entity frame work core to database.
> Dtos can be used to match Business Requirements.



Advantages of  DT0s :->
> Separation of Concerns
> Performance
> Security
> Versioning



ASYNCHRONOUS PROGRAMMING :->
> Traditional synchronous programming - programme is executed in block (waiting for long process to complete decreasing performance )
> Poor Performance
> Async/Await Keywords  (-> when we use this it can handle multiple task while one thread is waiting other threads will continue to Work)
> Handle More Request



REPOSITORY PATTERN :->
- Design pattern  to separate  the data access layer from the applcation
- Provides interface  without  exposing the  Implementation
- Helps Create Abstraction


                                   DbContext
                                      |
              CONTROLLER     --     REPOSITORY         --       DATABASE

- Repository pattern typically involves creating  an abstraction layer between application and database 
- Repository class is Responsible for Performing CRUD Operations exposes set of methods that application can use to interacat with the data.
- Repositories can be added inBetween the controller and the database .So that all the operations on the database is then handled by Repository.
- DbContext class is injected inside a Repository
- Controller will use Repository instead of using DbConext. Controller has No Aware of what's Being called through the DbContext.
- Controller is just using the interface methods exposed by the interface Repository.


BENEFITS :->
- Decoupling
- Consistency
- Performance
- Multiple data Source (SWITCHING).



AutoMapper :->
> Automapper is a popular object to object Library for  Dotnet Application including asp.net core
> It Allows us to simplify the mapping process between Two objects With Different Structures by defining Mapping Between Their properties
> Simplification.
> Map Between DTOs and Domain models and vice-versa.
>  Quite Powerful Apart from just Simple Object to Object Mapping.




Navigation Properties :->
> In entity Framework , core navigation properties are properties that allows us to navigate from one domain model to another or from one entity to another in a Relational DB.
> Walk Domain model  will have  Region naviation Property.
> Navigation proprties are typically defined in the form of an object or collection of object  that reference another entites
