REST
(representation state transfer)

-> Style of Architecture to build Web Services
-> Set of Principles

Rest is Stateless ( The Server should not store any Client State in the Server)

>Net core provides powerfull platform for bulding web services
HTTP verbs ,  Routing ,  Model Binding , COntent negotitation  , Response Type.

http verbs
Get, post, update , Delete ,  Patch , Options.

get -  get all employees
get  -  get all employyees/id
post  -  Create an Employee
put  -  Update an Employee
Delete  -  Delete an Employee

Dependencies nuget
Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer
Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools



DBContext Class

> maintaining connection to DB
> Track Changes
> Perform CRUD Operations
> Bridge Between domain names and DataBase


                CONTROLLER <>  DBCONTEXT <>  DATABASE



DEPENDENCY INJECTION

> Design pattern to increase Maintainibility and Testablility
> Dependency injection  built into  ASP.net  Core
> DI container  is Responsible for Creating and Managing Instances


Migration
Add-Migration "First Migration"(Name of Migration)
Update-Database


NEWID() is used to create guid inside db



DTOs (DATA TRANSFER OBJECTS)
> used  to transfer  data Between  Different layer
> Typically Contain a Subset  of the Properties in the domain Model
> For example  Transferring  data over a  Network


               [ CLIENT ]  -  [DTO (Data Transfer Layer)]   --  [[ A P I ]]  --  [DOMAIN MODEL]  -- [DATABASE]  ->

> we have domain model inside api .it is good practice to add a layer of DTO .
> we never Send domain model directly to client but we send DTO instead.
> Once we get dbcontext class provide us list of domain model then we do mapping  between domain model  and the DTO . So the we send DTO back to the client.
> if info comes from client . we receive DTO then we convert  DTO to domain model then we send  domail model using entity frame work core to database.
> Dtos can be used to match Business Requirements.



Advantages of  DT0s :->
> Separation of Concerns
> Performance
> Security
> Versioning



ASYNCHRONOUS PROGRAMMING :->
> Traditional synchronous programming - programme is executed in block (waiting for long process to complete decreasing performance )
> Poor Performance
> Async/Await Keywords  (-> when we use this it can handle multiple task while one thread is waiting other threads will continue to Work)
> Handle More Request



REPOSITORY PATTERN :->
- Design pattern  to separate  the data access layer from the applcation
- Provides interface  without  exposing the  Implementation
- Helps Create Abstraction


                                   DbContext
                                      |
              CONTROLLER     --     REPOSITORY         --       DATABASE

- Repository pattern typically involves creating  an abstraction layer between application and database 
- Repository class is Responsible for Performing CRUD Operations exposes set of methods that application can use to interacat with the data.
- Repositories can be added inBetween the controller and the database .So that all the operations on the database is then handled by Repository.
- DbContext class is injected inside a Repository
- Controller will use Repository instead of using DbConext. Controller has No Aware of what's Being called through the DbContext.
- Controller is just using the interface methods exposed by the interface Repository.


BENEFITS :->
- Decoupling
- Consistency
- Performance
- Multiple data Source (SWITCHING).



AutoMapper :->
> Automapper is a popular object to object Library for  Dotnet Application including asp.net core
> It Allows us to simplify the mapping process between Two objects With Different Structures by defining Mapping Between Their properties
> Simplification.
> Map Between DTOs and Domain models and vice-versa.
>  Quite Powerful Apart from just Simple Object to Object Mapping.




Navigation Properties :->
> In entity Framework , core navigation properties are properties that allows us to navigate from one domain model to another or from one entity to another in a Relational DB.
> Walk Domain model  will have  Region naviation Property.
> Navigation proprties are typically defined in the form of an object or collection of object  that reference another entites 



Authentication :->
> The Process to Determine a User's Identity
> UserName and Password
> By using authentication, we can check if we trust the User.

----  >  if we keep our api anybody who knows our url would be able to get all the resources from our api and we will be able to modify the data that we have
          stored in our SQL server. if user has bad intention they can even delete all the data.




Authorization :->
> Refers to the process of determining whether a user has Permission.
> Roles, Policies , Claims.
> Check if user has ReadOnly or ReadWrite Role.

----  > we have normal user coming to our API. logging In and are able to get the Resources.
      > ALso we have particular type of user which is admin user who are able to modify the data.



Authentication Flow :->
> we are using an authentication mehod in which the server creates a JWT token and pass it to the client
> json Web token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as
   A JSON object . This information can be verified  and trusted because it is digitally signed.



FLOW :->
> user will type  username and password using a login form and website will send this information to api.
> API will check username and password if information is correct it will generate a jwt token for website user.
> The Website user the uses this JWT Token as a way to make HTTP calls to the api to access the resource of the API and Get data from API
> Api will check if the token is correct .the API will return  the data  that the website  asked for.
if website doesn't send a JWT or it is invalid. No data returned from API.




                               Login using username and password
USERS    ---      WEBSITE      ----------------------------------->      API
                   www                 GET JWT Token
                                <---------------------------

                                Use JWT token to Make a CALL
                                --------------------------->
                                  GET data BACk
                                <---------------------------



Migration for Auth

//LOGGING
> Logging  in asp.net core web api refers to the process of Capturing and Storing Information about the application behaviour and Operations during RunTime.
> Logging is a critical Component of any application as it helps developers understand how their application is functioning and provides valuable insights and issues that may arise
> Diagnose and TroubleShoot  problems.


//we use 3rd party library SERILOG
> Popular                  > Flexible          > 3rd party
> Serilog is a popular logging framework for asp.net core that provides a flexible and powerfull  way to capture and Store Log Data can be integrated with asp.net core




//EXCEPTION HANDLING
> Handle any Unhandled Exceptions
> Create Consistant error response
> Avoid Repitation
